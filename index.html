	Hello people! My name is Andrew Vogler and if you got to this page you probably saw my facebook post about me creating a blog and you probably were curious to learn more what it is about.
<br><br>
Well let me tell ya... I've never done any actual blogging. I started journaling the other week and realized it is an amazing way to connect with God and get in tune with my thoughts. I thought it might be cool opportunity to share some of my more polished thoughts with the world because I do have a lot of thoughts. 
<br><br>
Also, I know virtually nothing about website design so I'm hoping I can use this opportunity to build a cool website where I can showcase the things I do with my time.
<br><br>
A while ago I decided I want to study abroad. Wut. I thought it was about time that I packed up my bags and fled the country. In reality it was a little bit of everything that pushed me to that decision. I'm just happy that it's actually gonna happen in a few short months. I'm traveling to Ireland for my study abroad program and I could not be more excited!
<br><br>
I'm actually very tired so I'll write about this stuff another day but I just wanted to make it publically known that I am leaving the country in just under two months. If you are reading this, shoot me a text and lets meet up!
<br><br>
