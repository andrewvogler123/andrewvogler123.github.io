<h1>About Me</h1>


	<p>
	Hi! I'm Andrew. I'm a musician, writer, runner, and thrill seeker who is living in Ames, Iowa. Through my passions, I've seen people get whipped up into crazy seasons of life. Through these people I've learned some things about life that inspired me to start writing.

	I don't claim to be an expert but I do enjoy sharing stories with others. So.. I hope that through my stories you will get to laugh, cry, and be reminded of the joy of being a human being.
	</p>-Andrew V.
